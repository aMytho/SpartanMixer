# SpartanMixer
A collection of scripts for the Spartans of Mixer. (and for anyone else who wants it )

Created using github in gitpod.

The purpose of this github project is to give streamers more control over their stream and channel bots. 

The chatbot will have all of the normal functions of a chabot (commands,moderation,ect) when fully completed.

Currently the main file used is commands.js  Feel free to experiment with other files if you wish. HowTo.js shows examples.

Usage-

Download the LTS version of NodeJS. https://nodejs.org/ Comlete the installation process.

Download this repository. It contains the chatbot code and all the nodes you need. (and a few extra that help with specific projects).

Navigate to the scripts folder.

Open Commands.js

Go to https://dev.mixer.com/guides/chat/chatbot
Select node and look at the first block of code. Click on 'click here to get an authkey' inside the block of code. Copy the code it gives you. 

In your commands.js file paste the authkey where it says "auth key here". You may need to get a new key if it expires.

Using the same format as the other commands you can copy and paste more commands into the createchatsocket function.
To send the bot to your chat run 'node commands.js' in a terminal in the proper directory. This depends on where the file is downloaded. 
To move directories just type 'cd path/to/scripts' EX. cd users/desktop/repo/scripts 

There is a few thrid party API's that are in the commands.js folder. (Advice,Pokedex,Dog and Cat facts) These are free API's and you should not take advantage of them. Do not spam them with requests.
